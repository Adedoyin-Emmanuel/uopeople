## Rants 🤨


Oh dear. I'm now doing **CS1102** and I will be writing a lot of **Java**. I really wished it was **C#**. But hey, I'm not complaining. I'm learning a lot of stuff. This should push me to take my **DSA** course in **Java** and try implementing them in **C#**. It's almost 2 months since I started writing Java and I think I like it. It looks so much like C#. Hopefully I will grab the DSA course I'm learning with it. Btw JavaFx is awesome. It was hard to set up probably because I'm coming from another lanaguage but yeah it works :blush:

Oh dear, Here we go again, CS2205-01 (web programming), this will be super simple 😅. I've been doing web dev for over 4 years now. Let's see how it goes.

Currently enjoying **CS3305-01**, very good, nice instructor. Writing PHP brings memories, I remember the early days of my Software Engineering career. I built stuff with PHP man, a chat app, school cbt, a little e-commerce app, scrappers and all. But now I write more of C#, Dotnet, Python and TypeScript. I still play PHP and Laravel sometimes but my heart is with TypeScript lol. Big fan of Microsoft technologies (C# and Typescript) btw.
